# Contributing to sass-pire

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a `bug` or `issue`
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix of `bug` or `issue`
- Proposing new `features` to be added
- Becoming a `maintainer` or `contributor` with us

## We Develop with Github

We use `GitHub` to host code, track `issues`, and `feature requests`, as well as `accept pull requests`.

## Pull Requests

Here's how you can make a `pull request` (PR):

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lines.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same `MIT` License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the `maintainers` if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using github's issues

We use `GitHub issues` to track public `bugs`. Report a `bug` by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be `specific`!
  - Give `sample code` if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* You can check out the `SCSS Guidelines` for coding conventions.
* Ensure your code passes the project's linting standards.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its `MIT` License.
